legendary Bean Point, the Rod & Reel Pier, and the most authentic Old Florida experience on the island.</p></section><article class="container section article-text"><p>The city of Anna Maria sits at the northern tip of Anna Maria Island, where Tampa Bay meets the Gulf of Mexico. It's the smallest, quietest, and most unspoiled of AMI's three neighborhoods — a place where cottages outnumber condos, everyone rides bikes, and sunsets at Bean Point feel like they belong on a postcard.</p><p>If Holmes Beach is AMI's heart and Bradenton Beach is its southern gateway, Anna Maria City is its soul. Here's your complete guide to this special corner of Florida's Gulf Coast.</p>

<h2>Bean Point: Florida's Most Secluded Beach</h2>

<p><strong>Bean Point</strong> is the reason many visitors fall in love with Anna Maria City. Located at the island's northernmost tip, this wild, untouched beach has no facilities, no umbrellas for rent, no vendors — just pristine sand, crystal-clear water, and the sound of waves.</p>

<p>What makes Bean Point truly special is its geography: you can walk from the Gulf side around to the Tampa Bay side, watching the water shift from ocean waves to bay calm in minutes. Dolphins are frequently spotted here, sometimes swimming just yards from shore.</p>

<div class="verdict-card">
<h3>🌅 Bean Point Tips</h3>
<p><strong>Parking:</strong> Very limited street parking on North Shore Drive. Arrive before 9am during peak season. <strong>Walk:</strong> 10-15 minutes from parking through a narrow sandy path. <strong>Bring everything:</strong> Water, snacks, chairs, shade — there are zero facilities. <strong>Best time:</strong> Sunrise is magical, and you'll often have the beach to yourself.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Rod & Reel Pier</h2>

<p>The <strong>Rod & Reel Pier</strong> has been an Anna Maria City institution for decades. Located on the Tampa Bay side at the north end of the city, it offers:</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>🎣 Rod & Reel Pier Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>Pier fishing</strong> — No license needed to fish from the pier. Rent rods and buy bait on-site. Catch snook, redfish, Spanish mackerel, and sheepshead depending on season.</p>
<p><strong>The restaurant</strong> — Possibly the most authentic waterfront restaurant on AMI. Casual, no-frills, and beloved by locals. Their grouper sandwich and key lime pie are legendary.</p>
<p><strong>Sunset views</strong> — The pier faces east, so mornings are spectacular. But the restaurant's waterfront patio catches beautiful evening light.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong> — The original pier dates to the early 1900s and has been rebuilt multiple times after storms. It's a symbol of AMI's resilience.</p>
</div>

<h2>Pine Avenue: AMI's Main Street</h2>

<p>Pine Avenue is Anna Maria City's charming main street, running from Tampa Bay to the Gulf of Mexico through the heart of the village:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boutique shopping</strong> — Small, locally-owned shops in restored historic cottages sell art, jewelry, clothing, and gifts</li>
<li><strong>Two Scoops</strong> — The island's favorite ice cream shop, with homemade flavors and a line out the door in season</li>
<li><strong>Art galleries</strong> — Several galleries showcase local Gulf Coast artists</li>
<li><strong>Historical Society Museum</strong> — Learn about AMI's history from Native American settlements through the fishing village era to today</li>
<li><strong>Weekend strolling</strong> — Pine Avenue is best enjoyed on foot, meandering from shop to shop with an ice cream cone in hand</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Eat in Anna Maria City</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Sandbar</strong> — Upscale waterfront dining with stunning Gulf views. Their seafood is exceptional, and the sunset cocktails are unforgettable. Reservations essential in season.</li>
<li><strong>Rod & Reel Pier Restaurant</strong> — Casual, no-frills, and utterly charming. The grouper sandwich is a must-try. Cash preferred; expect a wait.</li>
<li><strong>The Waterfront Restaurant</strong> — Bay-side dining with beautiful views and a more relaxed atmosphere than The Sandbar. Great for families.</li>
<li><strong>Beach House</strong> — Gulf-front dining just south in Holmes Beach but steps from Anna Maria City. Incredible sunset views.</li>
<li><strong>Duffy's Tavern</strong> — Local dive bar with surprisingly good food. The kind of place where everyone knows your name by your second visit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anna Maria City vs. Other AMI Neighborhoods</h2>

<div class="verdict-card">
<h3>🏡 Which AMI Neighborhood Is Right for You?</h3>
<p><strong>Choose Anna Maria City</strong> if you want maximum peace, Bean Point's untouched beauty, and true Old Florida charm. It's perfect for couples and relaxation seekers.<br><br><strong>Choose <a href="/guides/holmes-beach" style="color:var(--stone)">Holmes Beach</a></strong> if you want the most restaurants, shopping, and rental options — the "do everything" base camp.<br><br><strong>Choose <a href="/guides/bradenton-beach" style="color:var(--stone)">Bradenton Beach</a></strong> if you want Bridge Street's village charm, pet-friendly Coquina Beach, and the closest access to the mainland.</p>
</div>

<h2>Getting to Anna Maria City</h2>
<p>Anna Maria City is at the far northern end of the island, accessible via:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manatee Avenue Bridge (SR 64)</strong> — Main island access from Bradenton, then drive north through Holmes Beach (15 min from bridge)</li>
<li><strong>Sarasota-Bradenton Airport (SRQ)</strong> — 30-35 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Tampa International Airport (TPA)</strong> — 65-75 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Once in Anna Maria City, a bicycle is the best way to get around. The city is small enough to explore entirely on foot or by bike, and parking is limited near Bean Point and the pier.</p>
