    <strong>TL;DR Quick Summary</strong>
    The 15 best restaurants near Anna Maria Island, from waterfront seafood at The Sandbar to casual beach eats at Skinny's Place. Local picks, not tourist traps.
</div>
<p>Finding great restaurants near Anna Maria Island is easy — there are dozens of options within a short drive. But finding the places where locals actually eat, where the seafood is genuinely fresh and not frozen and reheated, takes insider knowledge. As vacation rental managers who have lived and worked in the Bradenton and Anna Maria Island area for years, we have eaten at every restaurant on this list multiple times. These are our honest recommendations, organized by category to help you find exactly what you are looking for.</p><h2>Best Waterfront Dining</h2><h3>1. The Sandbar Restaurant</h3><p>The Sandbar is the signature dining experience on Anna Maria Island. Located directly on the beach in Anna Maria City, you can literally dine with your toes in the sand while watching the sunset over the Gulf of Mexico. The menu focuses on fresh Gulf seafood — their grouper sandwich is legendary, the stone crab claws (in season, October through May) are outstanding, and the craft cocktails are well made. It is the most popular restaurant on the island, so reservations are essential during peak season, especially for sunset tables. Budget: $25–$50 per person.</p><h3>2. Mar Vista Dockside Restaurant & Pub</h3><p>Mar Vista occupies a historic 1912 building on the bayside of Longboat Key, just south of Anna Maria Island. You can arrive by boat or car, and the waterfront deck overlooks Sarasota Bay. The atmosphere is pure Old Florida — no pretension, just excellent food and stunning views. Their blackened grouper tacos and coconut shrimp are standouts. The restaurant has a relaxed, open-air feel that is perfect for families and couples alike. Budget: $20–$40 per person.</p><h3>3. Dry Dock Waterfront Grill</h3><p>Located in Longboat Key, Dry Dock offers an upscale-casual experience with seafood towers, fresh oysters, and craft cocktails. The waterfront patio overlooks the bay, and the wine list is one of the better selections in the area. This is a good choice for date nights and celebrations. Budget: $30–$60 per person.</p><h3>4. Star Fish Company Market & Restaurant</h3><p>Hidden in the fishing village of Cortez (just across the bridge from Anna Maria Island), Star Fish Company is as fresh as it gets — they sell fish from the docks and cook it right there. Order at the window, grab a picnic table on the waterfront, and enjoy some of the freshest seafood you will ever eat. No frills, no reservations, just incredible food. Their smoked fish dip is a must-try. Budget: $12–$25 per person.</p><h2>Best Casual Beach Eats</h2><h3>5. Skinny's Place</h3><p>Skinny's is an Anna Maria Island institution, open since 1989 and beloved by locals and returning vacationers alike. The burgers, hot dogs, and grouper sandwiches are served from a walk-up window, and you eat at picnic tables under the trees. There is nothing fancy here, and that is entirely the point. Cash only. Budget: $8–$15 per person.</p><h3>6. Rod & Reel Pier Restaurant</h3><p>Dining at the Rod & Reel Pier means sitting at the end of a wooden fishing pier with 360-degree views of Tampa Bay. The menu is simple — fish sandwiches, shrimp baskets, and cold drinks. Pelicans perch on the railings, dolphins may surface nearby, and the whole experience feels like stepping back 50 years. Breakfast here is excellent and less crowded than the lunch rush. Budget: $10–$20 per person.</p><h3>7. Poppo's Taqueria</h3><p>Multiple locations in the Bradenton area make Poppo's a convenient choice for quick, affordable Mexican-inspired food. The build-your-own tacos, burritos, and bowls use fresh ingredients and generous portions. It is a great option for <a href="/guides/family-vacation-anna-maria-island">families with kids</a> who want something fast without sacrificing quality. Budget: $8–$14 per person.</p><h2>Best Restaurants for Special Occasions</h2><h3>8. Beach Bistro</h3><p>Beach Bistro in Holmes Beach is one of the finest dining experiences on Anna Maria Island. The restaurant sits directly on the Gulf, and the menu features sophisticated seafood dishes with creative preparations — think lobster bisque with truffle oil, pan-seared diver scallops, and wine-paired tasting menus. This is the place for anniversaries, proposals, and celebrations. Reservations are required. Budget: $50–$100+ per person.</p><h3>9. Euphemia Haye</h3><p>Located on Longboat Key, Euphemia Haye is a beloved fine dining destination with a whimsical, eclectic atmosphere. The downstairs restaurant offers sophisticated entrees (duck, lamb, seafood), while the upstairs Haye Loft serves desserts and lighter fare in a more casual setting. Many guests do dinner downstairs and dessert upstairs. Budget: $40–$80 per person.</p><h2>Best Breakfast and Brunch Spots</h2><h3>10. The Waterfront Restaurant (Anna Maria City)</h3><p>This small restaurant on the bay in Anna Maria City serves excellent breakfast with waterfront views. The eggs benedict, banana-stuffed French toast, and fresh-squeezed orange juice are highlights. It gets crowded on weekends, so arrive early. Budget: $12–$20 per person.</p><h3>11. Anna Maria Island Beach Café (Manatee Beach)</h3><p>Located right at Manatee Beach, this casual café is the perfect spot for breakfast or lunch before or after a beach day. The acai bowls, breakfast burritos, and iced coffee are all solid choices. Budget: $10–$18 per person.</p><h2>Best Restaurants Off the Island (Worth the Drive)</h2><h3>12. Duffy's Tavern (Bradenton)</h3><p>A local Bradenton favorite, Duffy's offers affordable seafood baskets, juicy burgers, and cold beer in a laid-back outdoor setting with picnic tables and live music on weekends. Kids can run around the grassy area, and the vibe is relaxed. It is about 15 minutes from the island. Budget: $10–$22 per person.</p><h3>13. Oak & Stone (Sarasota / Bradenton)</h3><p>A modern gastropub with an excellent craft beer selection and creative pizzas. Good for a change of pace from seafood if you are on a longer trip. Budget: $15–$30 per person.</p><h2>Dining Tips From Locals</h2><ul><li><strong>Make reservations for waterfront restaurants</strong> — The Sandbar, Beach Bistro, and Mar Vista all fill up quickly during <a href="/guides/best-time-visit-anna-maria-island">peak season</a> (December–April). Book at least a day ahead, and several days for weekend sunset tables.</li><li><strong>Go early for casual spots</strong> — Walk-up restaurants like Skinny's, Star Fish Company, and Rod & Reel Pier do not take reservations. Arrive before noon to avoid long lines during season.</li><li><strong>Lunch is better value than dinner</strong> — Many waterfront restaurants offer the same views and similar menus at lunch for significantly lower prices.</li><li><strong>Check for seasonal closures</strong> — A few restaurants close briefly in September or October for maintenance. Call ahead if visiting during the quiet fall months.</li><li><strong>Bring cash</strong> — Skinny's Place and a few other casual spots are cash-only. There is an ATM nearby, but it is easier to come prepared.</li></ul><h2>The Best Seafood to Try Near AMI</h2><p>If you eat only a few things during your Bradenton-area vacation, make sure these are on your list:</p><ul><li><strong>Grouper sandwich</strong> — The signature dish of the Gulf Coast. Every restaurant does it differently — fried, blackened, or grilled. The Sandbar's version is a classic.</li><li><strong>Stone crab claws</strong> — In season from October 15 through May 15. Served chilled with mustard sauce. Billy's Stone Crab and Star Fish Company both serve excellent claws.</li><li><strong>Smoked fish dip</strong> — A Florida appetizer staple made from smoked mullet or mahi. Star Fish Company's version is exceptional.</li><li><strong>Key lime pie</strong> — A Gulf Coast essential. Nearly every restaurant offers a version, but Beach Bistro's is particularly good.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Do I need reservations at Anna Maria Island restaurants?</h3><p>For upscale and waterfront restaurants like The Sandbar, Beach Bistro, and Euphemia Haye, yes — especially during peak season (December through April) and for sunset seatings. Casual spots like Skinny's, Rod & Reel Pier, and Star Fish Company are first-come, first-served.</p><h3>Are Anna Maria Island restaurants expensive?</h3><p>Prices range widely. Casual spots like Skinny's and Poppo's serve excellent food for $8–$15 per person. Waterfront restaurants average $25–$50 per person. Fine dining at Beach Bistro can run $50–$100+.
